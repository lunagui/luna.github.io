## Why Forecast

1. Forecasting is required in many situations  
   From Stock market to House price, there are lost of demending out there.  
2. More practical for one person  
   I really want to creat a Robot, but it's hard to do it by myself.  
     
3. It's fun!

1. The data  
  I download the [data](http://www.dbh.govt.nz/nz-housing-and-construction-quarterly-open-data) comes from MBIEâ€™s tenancy bond database, which records all new rental bonds that are lodged each month.  
  
2. Forecast for Auckland  


```r
DT <- read.csv("data/geometric-mean-rents-by-ta.csv")
ts1 <- ts(subset(DT, select = Auckland), start = 1993, frequency=12)
ets1 <- ets(ts1,model="MMM");forec <- forecast(ets1, h = 12);plot(forec)
```

## Futher

1. That will be better if we can add more factors like bedrooms, bathrooms or Land area. They had raw data, but that based on how well I can understand them.

2. Forecast is a special fild of data since, which need more understanding of method R used to. I will dig them more.

3. Welcome anybody that intersted in and cantact with me: guiliying@gmail.com
